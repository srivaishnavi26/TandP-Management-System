    <h2>About the Training & Placement Cell</h2>
    <p>
      The Training and Placement Cell (T&P Cell) at SRIT plays a vital role in shaping the careers of students.
      It actively bridges the gap between academic learning and industry expectations through comprehensive training programs
      and strong placement support.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our team ensures students are industry-ready by organizing technical workshops, mock interviews, and collaboration with recruiters.
      We maintain a structured and transparent placement process that aligns studentsâ€™ capabilities with corporate requirements.
    </p>
    <p>
      The cell also promotes internships, skill-building seminars, and alumni interactions, offering students holistic exposure to the professional world.
